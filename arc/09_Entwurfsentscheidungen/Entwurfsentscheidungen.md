### UML support

There are possibilities to implement UML support. Check how complicated it is or if it's needed at all. 

1. [draw.io / diagramms.net](https://drawio-app.com/integrations-ecosystem/)

> With the source code available on Github, you (anyone!) can develop your own integrations. Right now, we have posted few examples in [JGraphâ€™s draw.io open source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/jgraph) including WebDav, HTML5, and GitHub that developers can use to create their own integrations. Many integrations already exist!

2. [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/de/api)

   Integrate PlantUML with own code by adding plantuml.jar in the classpath.

## UI Frameworks

We have to decide if we want to focus on functionality or on learning. Based on that we should choose the ui framework.
